### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

> **Action required** — review the migration steps below before deploying.

- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: resolved all 27 backend + 21 frontend `npm audit` findings. `form-data`, `multer`, `ws`, `js-yaml` (backend and frontend) fixed via non-breaking `npm audit fix`; `nodemailer` bumped to `9.0.3` (breaking, limited to stricter default TLS certificate validation, which this project's SMTP usage doesn't rely on bypassing); `@sentry/node`/`@sentry/nextjs` bumped to `10.65.0` and `pm2` bumped to `7.0.3` (both breaking-flagged, verified against this codebase's minimal usage of each — basic `Sentry.init()`/`setupExpressErrorHandler()` with only `dsn`/`environment`/sample-rate options, and `pm2`'s standard `apps`/`script`/`instances`/`exec_mode` config).


### Added

- **RMF Leveraged Authorizations**: RMF packages can now inherit controls and authorization posture from COTS/SaaS products, following the FedRAMP-style leveraged-authorization model. New table `rmf_leveraged_authorizations` (migration 111) links `rmf_packages` to `cots_products` with inheritance type (full/partial/hybrid), an inherited-control list, shared-responsibility notes, and expiration tracking. New route module `routes/rmfInheritance.js` provides CRUD, an eligible-products lookup, and at-risk flagging when the underlying COTS product is deprecated/retired or its authorization has lapsed.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- **Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) export**: generate a CRM as JSON, CSV, or PDF directly from a package's leveraged authorizations.
- **OSCAL SSP export**: export an RMF package as a NIST OSCAL 1.1.2 System Security Plan, including leveraged authorizations and per-control shared-responsibility annotations (`services/oscalService.js`).
- **Trust Center**: organizations can publish an opt-in, token-gated public page showing aggregate framework compliance and active-authorization counts (migration 112, `routes/trustCenter.js`, public page at `/trust/[token]`).  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- **Classroom mode**: guided, step-by-step training scenarios (migration 113, `routes/training.js`, `dashboard/training`) with three built-in templates plus an instructor progress view.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- **Anonymized industry benchmarking**: compare framework compliance against a k-anonymity-guarded peer aggregate (minimum 5 participating organizations), with an org-level opt-out (`routes/benchmarks.js`, `dashboard/reports`).
- **Compliance-as-code CI gate**: `GET /compliance/gate` returns HTTP 200/412 based on whether framework compliance meets a threshold, for direct use in CI pipelines with a service-account token.
- **Cyber Resilience module**: BC/DR, incident-response, and ransomware-playbook plan tracking with tabletop/functional/full-scale exercise logging and RTO/RPO attainment (migration 114, `routes/cyberResilience.js`, `dashboard/resilience`). A computed Cyber Resilience Score blends plan coverage, test cadence, RTO/RPO attainment, and existing backup-log health.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- COTS products gained `authorization_status`, `authorization_impact_level`, and `external_authorization_id` fields.

### Changed

- `GET /rmf/packages`, `/rmf/packages/:id`, and `/rmf/summary` now include leveraged-authorization counts and at-risk entries.
- **LLM provider/model catalog refreshed**: `providerConfig.js`'s `PROVIDERS` and `TASK_PROFILES`, plus every other place in the codebase that independently hardcoded a copy of the same model list (routing/fallback logic in `modelRouter.js` and `keyResolution.js`, quota-downgrade paths in `multiAgentOrchestrator.js`, API-key connectivity-check pings in `orgSettings.js`/`platformAdmin.js`, and the BYOK provider-picker UI in three frontend settings pages/components), now reference current model IDs across all six providers. Groq's entire prior lineup (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`, `gemma2-9b-it`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`) had been fully deprecated/decommissioned upstream and is replaced with `openai/gpt-oss-120b`/`20b`, `groq/compound`, `groq/compound-mini`, and `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`.  <!-- `🕐 Deprecation notice` -->
- **TEVV-DB-6/7 checks made real**: the `tevv-db` job's "syntactically valid SQL" and "unclosed DO block" checks previously never failed the build regardless of what they found, due to an uninitialized `FAILED` flag; TEVV-DB-6 also only scanned `migrations/07*.sql`/`08*.sql`, missing migration 104 (the RLS bug below) entirely. Both fixed, and TEVV-DB-6's detection logic replaced: its `DO \$\$`/`END \$\$` regex relied on a POSIX-basic-regex quirk that meant it almost never matched a real dollar-quoted block, so it now counts literal `$$` token pairs instead.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- **`tevv-db` job now runs real migrations**: added a `postgres:17` service container and an actual `npm run migrate` step to the job branded "Database & Migration Integrity," which previously never touched a database — pure grep over `.sql` text.
- **`security-pipeline.yml`'s migration step un-neutered**: `run: npm run migrate || echo "Migrations skipped for CI"` swallowed any real failure unconditionally; now a migration failure actually fails the build.

### Fixed

- **Row-Level Security was silently broken**: migration `104_row_level_security.sql` used invalid `ROW SECURITY` syntax (should be `ROW LEVEL SECURITY`) and had a dollar-quoting bug that broke policy creation for `evidence`/`audit_engagements`/`controls` — found and fixed by actually executing the full migration chain against a real Postgres instance for the first time.
- **AIBOM now genuinely derived from code**: `scripts/generate-aibom.js` previously hardcoded 4 of its 6 AI providers as fabricated "service" entries with made-up model lists (e.g. `gemini-1.5-pro`, which never matched the real `providerConfig.js` models); rewritten to derive the provider/model inventory from the live `PROVIDERS` object so it can no longer drift from the actual integration.
- **CodeQL `js/missing-rate-limiting`**: added an explicit per-router rate limiter to each of the six new route files (matching the existing `trustCenter.js` pattern), for parity with the companion `ai-grc-platform` fix — every flagged route was already covered by the app-wide `apiRateLimiter` mounted on `/api/v1`, which CodeQL's cross-file analysis can't trace; this closes the detection gap and adds a real second layer of defense.  <!-- `🔌 New API endpoint` -->
- **Per-router rate limiter ran before `authenticate`**: the six new route files applied their org-scoped rate limiter ahead of `authenticate`, so `req.user` was always unset when the limiter's key was built and every request silently fell back to a shared IP-based bucket instead of an org-scoped one. Fixed with a 3-way order — a cheap IP-based limiter first (bounds unauthenticated request volume before `authenticate`'s own DB/JWT work runs, and is what CodeQL's static analysis traces as covering the router), then `authenticate`, then the org-scoped limiter last, since it needs `req.user` for its key.  <!-- `🔌 New API endpoint` -->
- **AIBOM listed unused-capability providers as bundled dependencies**: the AI Bill of Materials treated all six BYOK LLM providers as `components` regardless of whether they have any real, shipped code dependency. Only `claude`/`openai` have actual npm SDK dependencies; `gemini`/`grok`/`groq`/`ollama` are called over plain HTTP only if an operator configures a key, with zero shipped SDK. Moved the latter into CycloneDX's dedicated `services` array alongside the existing internal AI Copilot/Analysis service entries, and added metadata clarifying that every provider reflects supported integration surface, not per-deployment runtime usage.
- **Controls list page mislabeled `verified` controls as "Not Started"**: `getStatusBadgeClass`/`getStatusLabel` only handled `implemented`/`satisfied_via_crosswalk`/`in_progress`, falling through to a gray "Not Started" badge for `verified`, `needs_review`, and `not_applicable` — so a control an auditor had verified rendered as if untouched. The control detail page already handled `verified` correctly; brought the list page in line with it and added the missing statuses to the status filter and both inline status-edit dropdowns.
- **Compliance gate undercounted `verified` controls**: `GET /compliance/gate` only treated `implemented`/`satisfied_via_crosswalk` as compliant, omitting `verified`, which every other progress query (`frameworks.js`, `dashboard.js`, `controls.js`) already counts as compliant — could return a false 412 even when the dashboard showed the threshold met.
- **Reverted migration idempotency edits on already-numbered files**: an earlier pass added `IF NOT EXISTS` guards to `001`, `005`, `057`, `105`, `107`, `108`, `109`, but editing an already-numbered (and likely already-deployed) migration changes its stored checksum, which makes `scripts/migrate-all.js` hard-fail with "Checksum mismatch" on any existing database — blocking the deploy of this PR's real new migrations, and contradicting this repo's own "never edit a deployed migration" rule. Reverted those seven files to their original content; the RLS syntax fix in `104_row_level_security.sql` is unaffected since it fixes a genuine bug rather than being purely defensive.
- **Cyber Resilience test date silently defaulted on malformed input**: `POST /resilience/plans/:id/tests` treated an invalid `test_date` (e.g. `not-a-date`) the same as an omitted one, silently recording the test against today's date instead of rejecting the request with 400 like every other date field in this route.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: resolved all 27 backend + 21 frontend `npm audit` findings. `form-data`, `multer`, `ws`, `js-yaml` (backend and frontend) fixed via non-breaking `npm audit fix`; `nodemailer` bumped to `9.0.3` (breaking, limited to stricter default TLS certificate validation, which this project's SMTP usage doesn't rely on bypassing); `@sentry/node`/`@sentry/nextjs` bumped to `10.65.0` and `pm2` bumped to `7.0.3` (both breaking-flagged, verified against this codebase's minimal usage of each — basic `Sentry.init()`/`setupExpressErrorHandler()` with only `dsn`/`environment`/sample-rate options, and `pm2`'s standard `apps`/`script`/`instances`/`exec_mode` config).

### 🕐 Deprecation Notices

- **RMF Leveraged Authorizations**: RMF packages can now inherit controls and authorization posture from COTS/SaaS products, following the FedRAMP-style leveraged-authorization model. New table `rmf_leveraged_authorizations` (migration 111) links `rmf_packages` to `cots_products` with inheritance type (full/partial/hybrid), an inherited-control list, shared-responsibility notes, and expiration tracking. New route module `routes/rmfInheritance.js` provides CRUD, an eligible-products lookup, and at-risk flagging when the underlying COTS product is deprecated/retired or its authorization has lapsed.

Groq's entire prior lineup (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`, `gemma2-9b-it`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`) had been fully deprecated/decommissioned upstream and is replaced with `openai/gpt-oss-120b`/`20b`, `groq/compound`, `groq/compound-mini`, and `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`.

### 📦 Database Migrations

> Run these migrations in order before starting the updated server.

- **Migration 104**: (the RLS bug below) entirely. Both fixed, and TEVV-DB-6's detection logic replaced: its `DO \$\$`/`END \$\$` regex relied on a POSIX-basic-regex quirk that meant it almost never matched a real dollar-quoted block, so it now counts literal `$$` token pairs instead.

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
cd controlweave/backend && npm run migrate
```

## v3.5.0 — 2026-05-18

> | Field | Value |
> |-------|-------|
> | **Version** | `3.5.0` |
> | **Release date** | 2026-05-18 |
> | **Tag** | `v3.5.0` |
> | **Release branch** | `release/3.5.0` |
> | **Built from** | `81ff13c5` |
> | **Ref** | `refs/heads/main` |


### Added
- **Expanded LLM model catalog** — Added Claude 4.x models (`claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`), GPT-4.1 family (`gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `o3`, `o4-mini`), Gemini 2.0 (`gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`), and additional Groq models (`mixtral-8x7b-32768`, `gemma2-9b-it`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`) across all provider dropdowns in the frontend and backend `providerConfig.js`.
- **BYOK-required AI access** — Platform no longer shares API keys with customer organizations. Each org must configure its own provider key. The `checkAIUsage` middleware now returns `422 NO_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED` before any LLM call is attempted when no key is found, replacing the previous silent 400 error from the LLM service.
- **AI Provider Setup modal** — Global `AiProviderSetupModal` component rendered from `DashboardLayout` covers all dashboard pages. When any AI feature is invoked without a configured key, the modal appears and highlights free providers (Google Gemini, Groq, Ollama) with direct links to obtain API keys, plus a CTA to Settings → LLM Configuration.
- **Global AI event interceptors** — Axios response interceptor in `api.ts` dispatches `ai:quota-exceeded` (429 + `upgradeRequired`) and `ai:no-provider` (422 + `NO_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED`) browser custom events; `DashboardLayout` listens and opens the appropriate modal without prop-drilling.
- **AiQuotaModal component** — Reusable modal for future quota-enforcement scenarios with "Add your own API key" and "Upgrade plan" CTAs.

### Changed
- **TASK_PROFILES defaults updated** — `reasoning`, `chat`, and `ideation` profiles now default to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (was `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) and `gpt-4.1` (was `gpt-4o`); `extraction` profile defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini` (was `gpt-4o-mini`). Existing org-level saved defaults are unaffected.
- **Community tier AI quota** — Removed the platform-key-sharing monthly cap; `aiRequestsPerMonth` restored to `-1` (unlimited) for all tiers since each org now supplies its own key.
- **Assets page upgrade modal removed** — The inline "Upgrade Required" modal in `assets/page.tsx` is replaced by the global `AiProviderSetupModal`; quota-exceeded errors on the assets page are now handled by the shared modal.

## v3.4.0 — 2026-05-16

> | Field | Value |
> |-------|-------|
> | **Version** | `3.4.0` |
> | **Release date** | 2026-05-16 |
> | **Tag** | `v3.4.0` |
> | **Release branch** | `release/3.4.0` |
> | **Built from** | `81ff13c5` |
> | **Ref** | `refs/heads/main` |


### Added
- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting replaces per-instance in-memory Map; falls back to in-memory when Redis is absent so single-instance deployments are unaffected.
- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (migration 104) on `controls`, `control_implementations`, `evidence`, `audit_engagements`, `audit_logs`, and `users`; `withOrgContext(orgId, fn)` in `database.js` activates the second enforcement layer per-request without touching existing routes.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- Sentry error tracking: `@sentry/node` wired to Express via `setupExpressErrorHandler`; `logger.setSentryClient()` forwards error-level log events; `@sentry/nextjs` added to the frontend with `sentry.client.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts`.
- Automated database backups via `node-cron` (`backupScheduler.js`); optional S3 upload in `db-backup.js`; activated with `BACKUP_ENABLED=true`.
- PM2 cluster mode: `ecosystem.config.js` with `instances: max`; `start:cluster` script and updated `start:railway` for Railway deployments.
- Redis response caching for dashboard: `redisCache.js` utility (`getCached`, `invalidateCached`, `invalidateCachedPattern`) with org-scoped keys; replaces single-instance in-memory cache Map in `dashboard.js`.
- CDN-friendly cache headers in `next.config.ts`: static assets (`/_next/static/*`) served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; HTML pages served with `no-cache`.
- Refresh token rotation on `POST /refresh`: every refresh issues a new refresh token and invalidates the previous one.
- Concurrent session limits at login: configurable via `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` (default 10); oldest session evicted when limit is reached.
- Optional HMAC signature layer on TPRM public endpoints: vendors send `X-TPRM-Signature: sha256=<hex>` when `TPRM_HMAC_SECRET` is configured; backward compatible with token-only auth.
- `verifyIncomingWebhook(secret, signature, body)` in `webhookService.js` for verifying incoming webhook callbacks from external systems.  <!-- `🔔 Webhook event` -->
- Local DB-backed integration harness at `controlweave/backend/scripts/qa-local-integration.js` for exact postcondition checks across framework adoption, control implementation, notifications, audit writes, org LLM settings, and cross-org isolation.

### Changed
- Hardened legacy backend QA scripts so they assert persisted behavior and current route contracts instead of allowing ambiguous `200 or 403` outcomes.
- RBAC QA now verifies evidence upload behavior, control-write persistence, audit-log access via `/api/v1/audit/logs`, and org LLM setting persistence.
- Endpoint smoke tests now derive tier-gating expectations from the authenticated org tier rather than treating both blocked and allowed responses as passing.
- Hardened the backend migration toolchain by rejecting unsupported migration files, rejecting duplicate SQL bodies, and defaulting checksum drift plus automatic baseline-on-error to off.
- Replaced the broken configuration-management migration with a UUID-safe SQL migration and removed duplicated TPRM schema replays from fresh installs.
- Backend startup now skips license DB lookup, reminder sweeps, AI-monitoring sync, and seed jobs when database config is intentionally absent in development, and `/health` reports a fast degraded `database:not_configured` status instead of cascading connection/auth errors.
- Passkey and SSO session rows now honor the configured refresh-token lifetime instead of hardcoding seven days, and the SSO callback now returns tokens in the URL fragment so they do not leak through query-string logging or referrers.
- Platform-admin overview now requires platform-owner authentication, audit log responses decrypt stored user emails before returning them to the UI, and QA coverage now asserts passkey email lookup, org switching session rotation, and the SSO callback fragment contract.

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- Users can now belong to and switch between **multiple organizations** under one account.

#### AIUC-1 Agentic AI Certification Framework (v2.4.0)

> **Tier:** 🟢 Free (2 max) · Starter (5 max) · Professional+ (Unlimited)
> Crosswalk mappings available on all tiers.
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- **`seed-aiuc1-framework.js`** — New seed script adding AIUC-1 as a supported compliance framework in ControlWeave. AIUC-1 is the first independently-audited certification standard purpose-built for agentic (autonomous) AI systems, developed by the Artificial Intelligence Underwriting Company (AIUC) with Schellman as the first accredited auditor.
- **31 controls** across six risk domains: Data & Privacy (DP-1–DP-6), Security (SEC-1–SEC-6), Safety (SAF-1–SAF-5), Reliability (REL-1–REL-5), Accountability (ACC-1–ACC-5), Societal Impact (SOC-1–SOC-5).
- **Crosswalk mappings** to NIST AI RMF 1.0, EU AI Act 2024, and ISO/IEC 42001:2023. OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 crosswalks included when that framework is pre-seeded.
- AIUC-1 added to `seed-frameworks.js` framework list with 13 core crosswalk pairs to existing AI governance frameworks.
- **AI Governance check** (`llmService.js`) updated to include `aiuc_1` alongside `eu_ai_act`, `nist_ai_rmf`, `iso_42001`, and `iso_42005`. Analysis prompt extended with AIUC-1 readiness assessment across all six domains.
- **Enterprise tier** — AIUC-1 gated at enterprise tier consistent with its use case (organizations deploying autonomous AI agents at scale).
- `npm run seed:aiuc1` — new seed script entry in `backend/package.json`.
- Landing page (`page.tsx`) updated to display AIUC-1 in the framework marquee and Enterprise pricing features list.

#### Self-Service Community License Generation & Admin Notification (v2.3.3)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- `licenseService.js`: added `generateCommunityKey(licensee, seats)` — generates a local RSA-2048 keypair, signs a community-tier JWT (perpetual, no `exp`), returns `{ licenseKey, publicKey }`. Private key is discarded after signing.
- `licenseService.js`: added `setLocalPublicKey(pem)` — stores a PEM public key in-module as fallback when `CONTROLWEAVE_LICENSE_PUBKEY` env var is not set. Used to verify self-generated keys.
- `licenseService.js`: `validateLicenseKey()` now accepts an optional `overridePubKey` parameter for self-validation during key generation.
- `licenseService.js`: `saveLicenseToDb()` now accepts an optional `localPublicKey` parameter (persists PEM to new `server_license.local_public_key` column).
- `licenseService.js`: `loadLicenseKeyFromDb()` now returns `{ licenseKey, localPublicKey }` instead of a plain string.
- Migration `097_server_license_pubkey.sql`: adds `local_public_key TEXT` column to `server_license` — stores the public key from `generate-community` so self-signed keys survive server restarts without env var changes.
- New endpoint `POST /api/v1/license/generate-community` (platform owner only): generates, activates, and persists a community license key in one step.  <!-- `🔌 New API endpoint` -->
- New script `scripts/generate-community-license.js` (`@tier: exclude`): CLI tool to generate a community license key. Prints keys for `.env` by default; `--activate` mode writes to database directly.
- `server.js`: `ensureLicenseFromDb()` now loads `local_public_key` from DB and calls `setLocalPublicKey()` so self-generated keys validate correctly on restart.
- `server.js`: `ensureLicenseFromDb()` sends a one-time email notification to `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAIL` when no license is active on startup. Silent if SMTP is not configured (logs structured warning instead).

#### Community License Key Support & Self-Hosted License API (v2.3.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> Rate limits vary by tier.
> **Affected area:** `backend`

- `licenseService.js`: Added `'community'` to `VALID_TIERS` — community-tier JWTs are now accepted by `validateLicenseKey()`. Previously, community license keys were silently rejected with "Invalid license tier".
- `edition.js`: Added `community: 'community'` to `LICENSE_TIER_TO_EDITION` — startup validation (`validateEdition()`) now correctly maps a community license to the community edition.
- New route `backend/src/routes/license.js` (`@tier: community`): provides `GET /api/v1/license` (current edition + persistence status) and `POST /api/v1/license/activate` (runtime license key activation with audit log). Both endpoints added to `server.js` and the public mirror allowlist.  <!-- `🔌 New API endpoint` -->
- Migration `096_server_license.sql`: new `server_license` table stores the activated key so it survives restarts. Users activate once via the UI — no `.env` editing required.  <!-- `📦 DB migration required` -->
- `server.js`: new `ensureLicenseFromDb()` startup function loads the DB-persisted license key and restores the edition automatically on restart.
- `licenseService.js`: added `heartbeatCheck()` — optional async background ping to `LICENSE_HEARTBEAT_URL` (disabled by default). Fires-and-forgets; connectivity failures are logged as warnings and **never revoke access**. Community self-hosted works fully offline.
- `backend/src/services/licenseService.js` and `backend/migrations/096_server_license.sql` added to the public mirror allowlist.
- Frontend: `licenseAPI.getInfo()` and `licenseAPI.activate(key)` added to `src/lib/api.ts`.
- `.env.example`: updated to explain that license keys are DB-persisted automatically, and to document the optional `LICENSE_HEARTBEAT_URL`.

#### BYOK — Unlimited AI Calls for Any Tier (v2.1.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- Community-tier orgs with a BYOK API key now receive unlimited AI requests. `AI_BYOK_BYPASS_TIERS` default changed from `'pro,enterprise,govcloud'` → `'community,pro,enterprise,govcloud'` in `tierPolicy.js`; propagates to `checkAIUsage`, `enforceDraftAiLimit`, `enforceImportAiLimit`.
- `/ai/status` endpoint now reports `limit: 'unlimited'`, `remaining: 'unlimited'`, `byokUnlimited: true` when bypass applies and org has ≥1 provider key configured. Previously returned the numeric cap regardless of actual enforcement.

#### Contributor License Agreement (v2.1.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- `docs/CLA.md` — Contributor License Agreement granting ControlWeave Inc. commercial relicense rights while contributors retain copyright.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — updated with CLA requirement and signing instructions.
- `.github/workflows/cla.yml` — automated CLA enforcement via `contributor-assistant/github-action`; signatures stored at `signatures/version1/cla.json`.

### Fixed

#### AI Monitoring (v2.1.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- AI Monitoring page usage card was always rendering `0 / 0` — `AIStatus` interface used non-existent flat fields (`usedThisMonth`, `monthlyLimit`); corrected to match actual API response shape (`usage: { used, limit, remaining, byokUnlimited }`).
- BYOK users now see ∞ Unlimited with a full green progress bar and "🔑 Using your own API key — no monthly cap" label.

#### Copy / Documentation (v2.1.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- Settings page: "3 AI requests per month" → "10 AI requests/month (unlimited with own API key)".
- Landing page Community tier: "AI-assisted assessments (10/mo)" → "(10/mo — unlimited with own API key)".
- Settings LLM section: surfaces BYOK unlimited benefit inline.

### Security

#### CLA Workflow Hardening (v2.1.2)

> **Tier:** 🟢 All tiers
> **Affected area:** `backend/frontend`

- Action pinned from mutable `cla-assistant/github-action@v2.6.1` to SHA `contributor-assistant/github-action@ca4a40a7d1004f18d9960b404b97e5f30a505a08` to eliminate supply-chain risk.
- Removed bot actor exclusions from job `if` condition — previously caused missing status checks for bot PRs, which could block branch protection. Bot auto-approval delegated to action's `allowlist`.

---

- Privacy policy page and footer links
- Responsive pricing grid with 1→2→3→5 column breakpoints
- CW emblem branding across app shell and auth screens
- Production-safe Redis adapter mode for real-time features

### Changed
- RMF step tracking is now observational only (not a deployment gate), consistent with NIST SP 800-37 philosophy

- `console.error` replaced with structured logger across all backend routes

### Fixed
- Stripe billing flow — redirect after registration, checkout session creation, portal session `returnUrl` validation  <!-- `💳 Stripe integration` -->
- Production build failure — `useSearchParams()` missing Suspense boundary in `register/page.tsx`
- Demo login credentials — passwords updated to comply with 12-char minimum policy
- Authentication middleware — resilient to missing `feature_overrides` column, non-fatal trial check failures
- Platform admin — bypass lockout, `is_active`, org requirements, and trial checks during login
- Railway deployment — correct builders, `startCommand`, PORT configuration, standalone runtime compatibility
- Docker frontend build — bake correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` via `.env.production`
- Pagination offset bug returning duplicate records on page 2+
- Pro tier incorrectly showing unlimited frameworks
- Menu path consistency: Settings → External Contacts
- Sidebar rail full-height with internal scroll
- CW emblem centering within branding
- Aria-current logic in Breadcrumbs and format-safe date parsing
- Vulnerability suppression — removed hardcoded MEDIUM severity filter so accepted items at any severity are hidden
- IP hygiene CI failures from marketing copy
- SARIF upload gracefully skipped when GitHub Code Scanning is not enabled  <!-- `🛡️ Security tooling` -->
- `articles` variable renamed to `articleRequirements` for clarity in EU AI Act page
- Missing `keywords` property in `soc-2/page.tsx` metadata restored

### Security
- **12-finding security audit remediation:**
  - Permission escalation — enforced `assessments.write` / `settings.write` on 10 organization mutation routes
  - Open redirect — validated Stripe billing `returnUrl` against allowlist
  - Multer DoS — added file size (50 MB) and file count (10) limits
  - RAG error leakage — sanitized internal error messages in AI responses
  - Billing webhook disclosure — masked internal errors in Stripe webhook handler
  - Billing rate limiting — per-IP throttling on payment endpoints
  - ILIKE wildcard injection — escape `%` and `_` in user-supplied SQL LIKE patterns
  - Portal session returnUrl — restrict to configured `FRONTEND_URL`
  - Threat intelligence filtering — sanitize output before returning to client
  - Frontend `alert()` replaced with inline error messages
  - Reasoning memory cache cap — prevent unbounded memory growth
  - Multi-agent timeout — enforce configurable execution deadline
  - Model router stats cap — prevent stats object from growing without bound
- CM branch naming enforcement — regex validation on all PRs and pushes (excludes `main`, `staging`, `release/*`)
- Multi-layer edition security to prevent community bypass of Pro features
- Hardened security pipeline: removed 3 redundant workflows, consolidated into single enhanced pipeline
- Pruned 144 stale remote branches for repository hygiene
