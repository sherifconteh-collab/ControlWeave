## What Is This?

ControlWeaver is a comprehensive multi-framework GRC platform. It manages compliance across 40 frameworks simultaneously, automates evidence collection, and offers optional BYOK AI assists — all fully open source under AGPL v3.

Positioning intent: GRC-first, MCP-native, and integration-first. AI is a supplement to the platform, not its centerpiece.

**Core differentiators:**

- **44 Frameworks, 1,190+ Controls** — NIST CSF, AI RMF, ISO 27001, SOC 2, CMMC 2.0, EU AI Act, HIPAA, NERC CIP, CIS Controls v8, COBIT 2019, FedRAMP High/Moderate, FINRA, SEC, SR 11-7, and 30 more
- **Auto-Crosswalk Engine** — Implement one control, automatically satisfy equivalent controls across other frameworks (40–60% effort reduction)
- **Optional AI Insights (BYOK)** — Gap analysis, compliance forecast, audit readiness, and inline assists on controls/evidence using your own Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Groq, or Ollama key. The platform works without any AI key configured.
- **RMF Lifecycle** — Full NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2 seven-step workflow with ATO tracking
- **MCP-Native** — Acts as an AI agent via Model Context Protocol for Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code
- **Open-Source Core** — AGPL v3 licensed; auditable, self-hostable, no lock-in

## Mobile Companion Apps

ControlWeave ships native iOS (SwiftUI) and Android (Jetpack Compose) companion apps that give compliance teams on-the-go access to dashboards, controls, assessments, and evidence capture directly from their devices.

### Features

| Capability | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| JWT authentication with TOTP 2FA | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dashboard overview (score, recent activity) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Controls list with pagination and search | ✅ | ✅ |
| Assessments view | ✅ | ✅ |
| Evidence capture (photo picker with HEIC/PNG/WebP/JPEG) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Push notifications (APNs / FCM) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Keychain / EncryptedSharedPreferences token storage | ✅ | ✅ |

### Backend Integration

The mobile apps consume the same REST API as the web frontend (`/api/v1`). Two endpoints were added specifically for mobile:

- `POST /api/v1/push-tokens` — registers/reassigns a device push token; uniqueness is enforced at the token level to prevent cross-account push delivery on shared devices
- `DELETE /api/v1/push-tokens/:token` — removes a push token at logout
- `POST /api/v1/billing/mobile-upgrade` — stub endpoint (billing is no longer active; returns 410)

Push delivery is handled by `pushService.js`. FCM (Android) is managed by `firebase-admin`, which is declared as an `optionalDependency` and installed automatically. APNs (iOS) is managed by `apn`, which must be installed manually for production because `apn` v2.x pins `node-forge@^0.7.1` and `jsonwebtoken@^8.x` — both have unfixed high-severity CVEs that would fail the CI audit gate. The service detects and uses `apn` automatically once it is installed; without it, only Android FCM push is delivered.

```bash
# Enable iOS push in production after auditing the dependency:
# Use --no-save to avoid it being committed back to package.json.
# Add this line to your Railway/Docker/systemd start script so it
# runs after "npm ci" in every deployment:
npm install --no-save apn
```

### Security Architecture

- **Token storage**: iOS uses `SecItemAdd`/`SecItemCopyMatching` (Keychain); Android uses `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (AES-256-GCM)
- **Push tokens**: globally unique constraint (`UNIQUE (token)` on `device_push_tokens`); new login reassigns token to current user, preventing stale delivery to prior accounts on shared devices
- **RevenueCat IAP**: the `revenueCatAppUserId` sent to the backend is derived from `req.user.id` server-side, not the mobile client — closing the cross-account subscription elevation vector
- **Token refresh**: Android OkHttp `Authenticator` guards against infinite 401 retry loops and validates the refresh response before rebuilding the request

### App Store / Play Store Compliance

The apps are structured to meet App Store Review and Google Play requirements out of the box:

**iOS**
- `Info.plist` includes `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`, and `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`
- `NSPrivacyPolicyURL` set to `https://controlweave.com/privacy` (replace with live URL before submission)
- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` declares all collected data types (Device ID for ad targeting, Product Interaction for analytics) and accessed API categories (UserDefaults, File timestamp)
- `NSAppTransportSecurity` has `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = false` (HTTPS only)
- `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false` (uses only OS-provided TLS)
- ATT opt-in prompt (`ATTrackingManager`) requested before showing AdMob ads

**Android**
- `targetSdk = 35` (Android 15) and `minSdk = 26` (Android 8.0)
- `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` enforces HTTPS
- `android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"` provides an auditable, explicit HTTPS-only policy with debug-only user-CA trust anchors
- `android:supportsRtl="true"` for right-to-left layout support
- All sensitive permissions declared: `CAMERA`, `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `AD_ID`
- ProGuard/R8 enabled for release builds (`isMinifyEnabled = true`)

### Environment Variables (Push Notifications)

```bash
# APNs (iOS push) — optional; push silently disabled if unset
APNS_KEY_ID=          # 10-character key ID from Apple Developer
APNS_TEAM_ID=         # 10-character Team ID
APNS_KEY_PATH=        # Path to AuthKey_XXXX.p8 file
APNS_BUNDLE_ID=       # com.controlweave.app (or your bundle ID)
APNS_PRODUCTION=true  # false for sandbox/TestFlight

# FCM (Android push) — optional; push silently disabled if unset
FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=  # JSON string (or path) of Firebase service account key
```

## Supported Frameworks

See [`docs/FRAMEWORK_COVERAGE.md`](./docs/FRAMEWORK_COVERAGE.md) for the full list with control counts, implementation priority by industry, and crosswalk coverage statistics.

All 40 frameworks are available to all users — no license key or subscription required:

**Core Compliance:** NIST CSF 2.0 · NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 · NIST SP 800-171 · NIST AI RMF 1.0 · ISO/IEC 27001:2022 · SOC 2 TSC · CMMC 2.0 · NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust) · FISCAM

**Regulatory & Industry:** HIPAA/HITECH · GDPR · CCPA/CPRA · EU AI Act · NERC CIP · FFIEC · OWASP Top 10:2025 · OWASP LLM Top 10 · OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 · MAESTRO

**AI & ISO/IEC Standards:** ISO 42001 · ISO 42005 · ISO/IEC 23894 · ISO/IEC 38507 · ISO/IEC 22989 · ISO/IEC 23053 · ISO/IEC 5259 · ISO/IEC TR 24027 · ISO/IEC TR 24028 · ISO/IEC TR 24368

**Financial Services:** FINRA Notice 24-09 · SEC AI Risk Management · SR 11-7 (Federal Reserve / OCC)

**AI Regulatory Monitoring** — The platform can monitor selected privacy and regional frameworks for upcoming regulatory changes, new compliance requirements, enforcement deadlines, and emerging state and international laws. Powered by the configured LLM provider via the existing `regulatoryMonitor` API.

**Master Context & Provider Handoff** — Every AI call is injected with a dynamically-built organization context prompt (`orgContextService.js`) that includes industry, frameworks, compliance posture, CIA baseline, deployment model, cloud providers, data sensitivity types, asset inventory, and open vulnerabilities. When a user switches LLM providers in Settings, cached API keys are immediately invalidated and the next AI call sends the full context to the new provider — zero reconfiguration required.

## Positioning Guardrails

- Build as an orchestration layer (not a closed monolith): prioritize connectors, APIs, and MCP interfaces.
- Keep evidence automation as a core wedge: ingestion, integrity checks, linkage, and audit-ready exports.
- Maintain independent UX and product language; avoid reproducing competitor-specific flows verbatim.
- Optimize for mid-market speed-to-audit and operator productivity.

Detailed guardrails: [controlweave/docs/POSITIONING_GUARDRAILS.md](controlweave/docs/POSITIONING_GUARDRAILS.md)

## Security

ControlWeave ships with a layered security posture:

- **Encryption at rest** — User PII (email) encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**; HMAC-SHA-384 search indexes; CNSA Suite 1.0 compliant. Runtime `auditEncryptionStrength()` verifies algorithm, key length, HMAC strength, and TLS floor on every server start — server refuses to start if any check fails
- **Encryption in transit** — TLS 1.2+ enforced globally (`tls.DEFAULT_MIN_VERSION`); MCP → REST API channel throws on non-HTTPS in production, warns before sending credentials over plain HTTP
- **Authentication** — bcryptjs (14 rounds) password hashing; JWT access (15 min) + refresh (7 day) tokens; hashed refresh tokens in DB
- **Account lockout** — Per-account failed login counter with configurable lockout (default: 5 attempts → 15-minute lock, `Retry-After` header on 423 response)
- **Rate limiting** — IP-based rate limits on auth endpoints; per-org AI rate limits inside the API
- **Input sanitization** — Null bytes, `<script>` blocks, and HTML tags stripped from all user string inputs
- **Request size limits** — 2 MB body size cap (prevents payload-bomb DoS)
- **Security headers** — HSTS, CSP (`frame-ancestors 'none'`, `default-src 'self'`), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **CORS** — Restricted to configured origins (`CORS_ORIGIN`)
- **RBAC** — Granular permission checks on every protected route
- **Parameterized queries** — All DB queries use parameterized statements (no SQL injection surface)
- **Dependency auditing** — `npm run audit:check` (moderate+ severity threshold)

## CI/CD Pipeline & PR Checks

All pull requests targeting `main` or `develop` run the full security and compliance pipeline before merge is permitted. The pipeline implements **NIST SP 800-160** systems security engineering principles and **CM-3/CM-4** change control requirements.

### Job 1 — Backend Build & Test (MANDATORY, blocks all downstream)

| Check | Command | Failure Behaviour |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Dependency install | `npm ci` | Blocks |
| **Syntax check** | `npm run check:syntax` | **Blocks merge** |
| **IP hygiene check** | `npm run check:ip-hygiene` | **Blocks merge** |
| Build | `npm run build` | Blocks |
| **Security audit** | `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` | **Blocks merge** |

### Job 2 — Frontend Build & Test (MANDATORY, blocks all downstream)

| Check | Command | Failure Behaviour |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Dependency install | `npm ci` | Blocks |
| **TypeScript type check** | `npm run typecheck` | **Blocks merge** |
| **ESLint** | `npm run lint` | **Blocks merge** |
| **Production build** | `npm run build` | **Blocks merge** |
| **Security audit** | `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` | **Blocks merge** |

### Job 2.5 — QA Testing Suite

Runs against a live PostgreSQL 14 instance (pgvector extension). Suites controlled via `QA_DYNAMIC_SUITES` env var:

| Suite | Command | What It Tests |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Syntax** | `npm run check:syntax` | All JS files parseable |
| **IP Hygiene** (strict) | `IP_HYGIENE_FAIL_ON_STANDARDS=true npm run check:ip-hygiene` | No proprietary IP patterns |
| **Dynamic E2E** | `npm run qa:e2e:dynamic` | Core API flows end-to-end |
| **Auditor workflow** | `QA_DYNAMIC_SUITES=auditor npm run qa:e2e:dynamic` | Full auditor engagement → sign-off |
| **Crosswalk verification** | `npm run qa:crosswalk:live` | Crosswalk mappings integrity |

### Job 3 — CodeQL SAST Analysis

GitHub CodeQL scans JavaScript with `security-extended` + `security-and-quality` query suites. Results saved as SARIF artifacts (uploaded to GitHub Security tab if Advanced Security is enabled on the repo).

Language matrix: `['javascript-typescript']` (covers both backend Node.js and frontend TypeScript/React).

### Job 4 — Dependency Vulnerability Scan

`npm audit` runs on both backend and frontend independently. Results exported as JSON artifacts and retained for 30 days. The audit step in the build jobs enforces `--audit-level=moderate` as a hard gate; this job captures the full JSON detail for the vulnerability analysis job.

### Job 5 — Secrets Detection (runs in parallel, no dependency)

Two scanners run simultaneously:

| Scanner | What It Catches |
|---------|----------------|
| **TruffleHog** | Verified secrets: API keys, tokens, credentials in git history and current files |
| **Gitleaks** | Pattern-based secret detection across the full diff |

Both run on the git diff between base and head SHA — not the full repo history — to keep CI fast while catching new commits.

### Job 6 — Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

CycloneDX generates a SBOM for both backend and frontend `node_modules`. Output format: JSON (CycloneDX schema). Artifacts retained 90 days. The SBOM feeds into the vulnerability cross-reference features inside ControlWeave itself.

### Job 7 — Generate AIBOM (AI Bill of Materials)

`scripts/generate-aibom.js` inventories all AI models, providers, and agentic components referenced in the codebase (LLM integrations, OpenClaw agents, MCP tools). Summary posted as PR comment. Artifacts retained 90 days.

### Job 8 — Container Build & Trivy Security Scan

Builds Docker containers for both backend and frontend via Dockerfile. Trivy scans each image for **CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM** CVEs. SARIF output uploaded to GitHub Security tab (if Code Scanning is enabled). Images are NOT pushed — build-and-scan only.

Depends on: `codeql-analysis`, `dependency-scan` (runs after both pass).
Condition: `main` branch or any pull request.

### Job 9 — DAST with OWASP ZAP (main branch only)

ZAP Baseline Scan against `https://demo.controlweave.com` (requires the demo environment to be running; configure via the `ZAP_TARGET` workflow input or `DAST_TARGET_URL` secret). Catches runtime vulnerabilities not visible at static analysis time: reflected XSS, insecure headers, CORS misconfigurations, path traversal.

Condition: `main` branch only (post-merge). Does not block PRs.

### Job 10 — Vulnerability Analysis & Review Flagging

Aggregates findings from all security jobs. Applies risk-acceptance suppressions from closed `security,vulnerability-review` GitHub issues. Generates:

- **CM-3 Security Impact Analysis** report (NIST SP 800-53 CM-3/CM-4 alignment)
- `vulnerability-review.json` with structured findings
- GitHub Issues for any Medium+ unsuppressed findings

**Vulnerability severity gate:**

| Severity | Default Behaviour | Override |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Critical | ❌ Fails pipeline | `FAIL_ON_CRITICAL_VULNS=false` |
| High | ⚠️ Creates review issue | `FAIL_ON_HIGH_VULNS=true` to block |
| Medium | ⚠️ Creates review issue | — |
| Low | ℹ️ Informational | — |

Risk acceptance workflow: close the generated GitHub issue with `security,vulnerability-review` labels → suppressed in future runs.

### Pre-PR Developer Checklist

Before opening a PR, run these locally:

```bash
# Backend checks (from controlweave/backend/)
npm run check:syntax              # Must pass — zero errors
npm run check:ip-hygiene          # Must pass — review any warnings
npm audit --audit-level=moderate  # Must pass — fix or accept with documented rationale
npm run build                     # Must succeed

# Frontend checks (from controlweave/frontend/)
npm run typecheck                 # Must pass — zero type errors
npm run lint                      # Must pass — zero ESLint errors
npm run build                     # Must succeed

# Database (if changing migrations)
npm run migrate                   # Must run cleanly on a fresh DB
# Test rollback manually if migration is reversible
```

**Branch naming** (CM-controlled, required for merge):
```
<type>/CW-<number>/<short-description>

Examples:
  feat/CW-101/rmf-lifecycle-dashboard
  fix/CW-102/crosswalk-auto-satisfy-bug
  security/CW-103/multer-dos-fix
  migration/CW-104/add-aibom-tables
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

feat(rmf): add authorization decision deactivation logic
fix(billing): resolve Stripe redirect after registration
security(routes): enforce write permissions on org mutations
migration(db): add rmf_packages and rmf_step_history tables
```

**PR title** must match commit message format. PR description must reference the CM tracking number (`Closes CW-XXX`) and list affected areas (backend / frontend / migration / docs).
